## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Client Application (React + TypeScript)**
   - Location: `/client/src`
   - Key Features:
     - Real-time request processing
     - AI agent integration
     - Blockchain transaction monitoring
     - Administrative dashboard

2. **Server Application (Node.js + TypeScript)**
   - Location: `/server`
   - Core Services:
     - Request processing
     - AI agent management
     - Blockchain integration
     - Data persistence

### Data Flow

1. **Citizen Request Processing**
   ```
   User Input -> API Gateway -> Request Service -> AI Agent -> Blockchain -> Response
   ```
