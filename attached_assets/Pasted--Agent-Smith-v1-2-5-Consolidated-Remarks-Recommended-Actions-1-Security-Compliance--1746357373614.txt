# Agent Smith v1.2.5 – Consolidated Remarks & Recommended Actions

## 1  Security & Compliance

* **Plain‑text secrets in UI** – Moralis API keys, Hyperledger URLs and other tokens are visible.
  *Action:* introduce a `SecretField` component that masks values by default and backs them with HashiCorp Vault.
* **No multi‑factor update flow** for critical keys.
  *Action:* require role‑based approval + OTP before any secret is revealed or rotated.

## 2  Workflow Rules Engine

* **No rule priority / collision handling** – overlapping keyword sets may assign tasks to multiple departments.
  *Action:* add an explicit `weight` / `order` field or drag‑to‑sort list; log the rule that fired.
* **No sandbox test** – admins cannot validate a rule before activating.
  *Action:* “Test rule” button that runs the filter against recent tasks.

## 3  RAG Data Management

* **UI exposes RAG config but has zero data sources** – creates dead‑end experience.
  *Action:* file uploader (PDF, CSV) + connector picker (S3, SQL, SharePoint) that pipelines into Milvus.
* **Prompt versioning missing** – cannot track changes to system prompts.
  *Action:* store prompt revisions with timestamp & diff; add revert button.

## 4  Monitoring & FinOps

* **No cost / usage metrics per agent** – hard to budget or throttle.
  *Action:* push vLLM/Ray token counts to ClickHouse → Grafana dashboard.
* **LLM pool health not exposed** – risk of silent 429 / latency spikes.
  *Action:* surface queue length, GPU util, HPA status in Analytics/Health widget.

## 5  Bulk Operations & Productivity

* **No multi‑select in Kanban boards** – operators must process tickets one‑by‑one.
  *Action:* checkbox column + bulk actions (Close, Reassign, Export).
* **Org import absent** – large hierarchies require manual entry.
  *Action:* CSV/LDAP sync wizard.

## 6  Access Control Transparency

* **Role badges absent** – users can’t see who is admin vs. viewer.
  *Action:* display RBAC badge next to avatar; gate sensitive screens with OPA policies.

## 7  DAO Governance UX

* **Gas / network information hidden** – voting modal lacks tx‑fee, network‑id, contract URL.
  *Action:* show tx hash, gas estimate and link to explorer before confirm.

## 8  LLM Performance & Capacity

* **Autoscaling blind‑spot** – no alerting on GPU saturation or Ray back‑pressure.
  *Action:* set Prometheus alerts for >80 % GPU or queue >N tasks; auto‑scale Ray workers.

## 9  Mobile & Accessibility

* **Drag‑and‑drop not touch‑friendly** – tablets in field offices will struggle.
  *Action:* implement touch handlers; ensure WCAG AA contrast ratios.

## 10  Misc. UX Enhancements

* Global date filter on dashboard for trend analysis > 30 days.
* Quick‑“Ping” buttons on every integration row to validate connectivity.
* Health widget aggregating Besu, Milvus, Vault, GPU across cluster.

**Effort Estimate:** \~11 developer‑days (2 sprints, 3 engineers) to clear P0–P1 items.

**Compliance Impact:** Vault integration + audit‑trail enhancements close the remaining SOC 2 CC6/CC7 and ISO 27001 A.9, A.12 gaps.
